# 1. Project Overview

This project analyzes a simulated transactional sales dataset representing one year of operations for a pizza restaurant.

The objective was to design a structured relational database and perform analytical SQL while applying performance optimization techniques.

Unlike a basic SQL practice project, this version emphasizes:

* Schema normalization

* Constraint enforcement

* Workload-driven indexing

* Execution plan validation using EXPLAIN

* Structured data ingestion using Python
  

# 2. Business Objectives

This analysis aims to answer the following:

* Which pizzas generate the highest revenue?

* Which pizza size has the highest demand?

* Which category contributes most to overall revenue?

* What are peak sales hours and peak weekdays?

* How does revenue change month-over-month?

* Does a small subset of pizzas contribute most of the revenue (Pareto principle)?
* 

# 3. Dataset

Source: Publicly available pizza sales dataset (Kaggle)

Scope: One year of transactional sales data.

## Tables
## orders

* order_id – Unique identifier for each order

* date – Order date

* time – Order time

In the optimized schema, date and time were merged into a single order_datetime column for improved filtering and indexing efficiency.

## order_details

* order_details_id – Unique row identifier

* order_id – Foreign key referencing orders

* pizza_id – Foreign key referencing pizzas

* quantity – Quantity ordered

## pizzas

* pizza_id – Unique identifier (type + size combination)

* pizza_type_id – Foreign key referencing pizza_types

* size – S, M, L, XL, XXL

* price – Price in USD

## pizza_types

* pizza_type_id – Unique identifier

* name – Pizza name

* category – Classic, Chicken, Supreme, Veggie

* ingredients – Comma-delimited ingredient list

Note: Ingredients are stored as a delimited string for simplicity. This could be further normalized into a separate ingredient table if ingredient-level analysis were required.


# 4. Database Design & Normalization

The schema was designed using relational modeling principles.

## Key Improvements

* Implemented PRIMARY KEY and FOREIGN KEY constraints

* Added CHECK constraints for positive price and quantity

* Replaced separate date and time columns with order_datetime

* Used consistent constraint naming conventions

* Avoided redundant indexing  
Schema file available in: schema/pizzahut_schema.sql


# 5. Indexing & Performance Strategy

Indexes were created based on cardinality and selectivity analysis rather than blindly indexing all columns.

## Implemented Indexes

* idx_orders_order_datetime

* idx_pizza_types_category

## Performance Validation

Used EXPLAIN to verify:

* Range scans for date filtering

* Indexed joins through foreign keys

* Appropriate full table scans for aggregations

* Sorting behavior in window functions

This ensures indexing is applied only where it meaningfully improves query performance.


# 6. Data Ingestion

Data was loaded into MySQL using a Jupyter Notebook.

## Tools Used

* Pandas

* SQLAlchemy

* mysql-connector

## Steps Performed

* Read CSV files

* Checked for null values and duplicates

* Inspected data types

* Inserted into predefined MySQL schema

* Used to_sql(method='multi') for batch insertion

Note: Minimal transformation was applied. Data integrity is enforced at the database level using constraints.
